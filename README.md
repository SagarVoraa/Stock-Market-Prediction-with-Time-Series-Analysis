#Stock Market Prediction with Time Series Analysis
Implemented extensive ETL for modeling data, forecasting tomorrow's opening price relative to yesterday's close. Utilized yfinance library for historical market data, focusing on S&P 500 for predictions. Rigorous data cleaning, manipulation, and null value handling ensured a stable dataset for modeling. I have Employed Random Forest to identify key features/KPIs for stock prediction. Additionally, ran a basic ARIMA model for enhanced time-series predictions. The GitHub repository includes detailed code and documentation.
